# GitHub Action for Consistent SEMVERs

## Usage:
```yml
  - uses: mapped/action-semver@v0.1.0
    with:
      baseVersion: '1.2.3'
```

### Options
 - **baseVersion** - The base version of this repo. This value must be manually updated when the base version is incremented.
 - **branchMappings** - Used for mapping untagged branches to tag names. Mappings are one per line, each as `branch:target_name`.
   - Optional, default = `main:latest`
 - **prereleasePrefix** - The <pre-release> prefix on an untagged SEMVER.
   - Optional, default = `prerelease`
 - **versionFile** - The filename where the full SEMVER and commit SHA should be written.
   - Optional, default `VERSION`

## Capabilities
This GitHub Action creates consistent SEMVER and tag environment variables with a few simple rules:
 1. If the Action was triggered by the creation of a tag, the tag's SEMVER is used
 2. If the Action was triggered by a push, the SEMVER passed to this action is augmented with a pre-release and build number, and the tag is either the branch name or a mapped value _(for example `main` can be mapped to `latest`)
 3. If the Action was triggered by a PR, the SEMVER passed to this action is augmented with a pre-release and build number, and the tag is set to `merge`

## 1. Release Tag Created
With the following input:
  - Action run# 23
  - ```yml
      - uses: mapped/action-semver
        with:
          baseVersion: '1.2.3'
          branchMappings: |
            main:latest
          prereleasePrefix: 'prerelease'
          versionFile: 'VERSION'
    ```
  - Last commit in the tag: `a8cb3d0eae1f1a064896493f4cf63dafc17bafcf`
  - `v3.4.5-alpha.1` **release tag is created**

This action will produce the following environment variables:
 - `VERSION_TAG`=`v3.4.5-alpha.1`
 - `SEMVER`=`3.4.5-alpha.1+20200918T041126920Z.a8cb3d0e`
 - `SEMVER_MAJOR`=`3`
 - `SEMVER_MINOR`=`4`
 - `SEMVER_PATCH`=`5`
 - `SEMVER_PRERELEASE`=`alpha.1`
 - `SEMVER_BUILD`=`20200918T041126920Z.a8cb3d0e`

and create a `VERSION` file with the contents:
```
3.4.5-alpha.1+20200918T041126920Z.a8cb3d0e
```

_Note that the `20200918T041126920Z` portions are UTC datetime strings representing the time the action was run._
